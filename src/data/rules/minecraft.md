> Using any kind of automation/cheat/hack in prison will result severe punishments.
> If you stuck in prison for more than 2 days, open a [ticket](https://discord.com/channels/1426898495230709852/1426918443533471744).

> If you have cheat/hack for other servers and we caught you, you can still receive punishments.
> If you think its unfair: Why do you need to show to people you have cheats/hacks first of all?
